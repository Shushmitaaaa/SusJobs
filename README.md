# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fake Job Detector ‚Äì AI-Powered Job Scam Identifier



**Fake Job Detector** is an AI-powered tool that helps job seekers identify fraudulent job postings. With a trained machine learning model and integrated Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite LLM, this tool not only classifies jobs as *Real* or *Fake* but also explains **why** a job is likely fraudulent  helping users stay safe from scams demanding personal data or money.

### How It Works ‚Äì Step-by-Step

### Dataset Collection

* Used dataset from kaggle.
* Contains job descriptions labeled as fake or real.

### Data Cleaning

* Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., job ID, salary range).
* Replaced null values with blank strings for consistency.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Used `RandomUnderSampler` (from `imblearn`) to handle data imbalance ‚Äì there were too many real jobs vs. fake.
* Visualized:

  * Number of job postings per country (USA dominated).
  * Job experience distribution (Entry-level had the highest share).
  * Most common words in **real** vs. **fake** job descriptions using word clouds.

### Text Preprocessing

* Removed stopwords using NLTK to clean up textual noise.
* Normalized and tokenized the text data.

### Train-Test Split & Vectorization

* Split data into train and test sets.
* Used **CountVectorizer** to convert job descriptions into numerical form (Document-Term Matrix).

### Model Building & Evaluation

* Trained using **Naive Bayes** ‚Äì known for strong performance on text data.
* Also tried **Decision Tree**, but Naive Bayes + CountVectorizer gave better accuracy.
* Evaluation Metrics:

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **F1 Score**
  * **Support**

### Model Saving

* Saved the trained model and vectorizer using `pickle` for web deployment.

### LLM Integration (Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite)

* Integrated Google‚Äôs Gemini Flash model to explain **why** a job is real or fake.
* After prediction, users can click the **"Explain Why"** button to get an AI-generated reasoning.
